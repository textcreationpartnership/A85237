            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119621:5"/> also to publish in writing, such things as men think any wise benefitiall. I have therfore, with disire of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the good of all those that shall accept of my paines, but principally of you my loving brethren (to whom it is most of all due) recollected my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon some places of the holy scripture which heretofore I have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God's helpe, and whereof you have bin hearers, in our publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises in the church; Not in the least judging them, in respect of any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expressions or methood, worthy of acceptaunce, (they being performed in all plainnesse) but cheiflie desireing thereby to put you in mynd of some thinges, which formerlie ye have heard, because I see both in my selfe, and others, too great a neglect of the things we heare, and manie times doctrine which should be earnestly minded by us, is no sooner delivered, but forgotten, according to the proverb, in at one

            <p>We may read in the former chapter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32: 1.</note> that Moses staying long in the Mount

                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32: 1.</note> children of Israel corrupted their wayes, and gathered them selves togither to Aaron, and said, up make us Gods to goe before us; for as for this Moses the man which brought us out of the land of Aegipt, we wote not what is become of him. Whereupon Aaron made them a<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32: 4.</note> calfe; &amp; they worshipped it, and said, these by thy Gods ô Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Aegipt. So they turned the image of the invisible<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 106: 20.</note> God into the likenesse of a calfe that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 23. 25.</note> grasse: and worshipped the creature in stead of the Creator, who is blessed for evermore Amen.</p>
            <p>This their sin did greatly displease the Lord, and his servant Moses; in so much, that the anger of Moses waxed so hot, that he brake the tables beneath the mount, wherein the law was written by<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32: 10. 11.</note> had bin utterly consumed. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they scaped not all togither shot-free,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119621:10"/> but a great plague fell upon them; &amp; (which is more) it seemeth, that the Lord with drew the visible signes of his presence which they enioyed in times past: and now the Lord would onlie send an Angell with them, in remembrance of his promise to Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Jacob, to bring them into the promised land; though not that Angell of the covenant, which heretofore had gon with them, but only the ministration of some other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to destroye their enemyes before them. See Exod. 23: 20. 21. with Cap. 32: 34. and Cap. 33: 2. 3. 4,</p>
            <p>This being the sin, &amp; punishment for the same, in this 33<seg rend="sup">th</seg> chapter we have set forth unto us the reconciliation or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made between God &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; that by his servant Moses, who was the mediator &amp; minister of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, as saith the scripture, the lawe was given by Moses, but faith &amp;<note place="margin">

In the making of which attonement we may note, first, the preparation thereunto which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth 1. in the evill tydinges brought unto the people, and their mourning &amp; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereupon, being stript of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119621:11"/> by the commandement of God▪ vers 4. 5. 6. 7. 2ly the removing of the tent or tabernacle of Moses out of the campe, from amongst this rebellious rout, signifying Gods displeasure against, and departure from his people▪ compare Nomb. 2: 17. with Psal. 10: 1. Pro. 15: 29. Secondly the reconciliation it selfe, contained from vers 11. to the end of the chapter; wherein we have first, Moses his expostulation with God. vers 12. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his earnest prayer grounded upon the causes of that expostulation. vers. 13. thirdly, Gods gratious answere. vers 14. frourthlie, Moses thankfull acceptation, and embraceing that promise of God. vers 15. wherin he doth (the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to move God to the performaunce thereof) second or backe his former peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a deprecation against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, together with more reasons (as it were) to move the Lord to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce thereof vers 16. where upon we have Gods renewing or reiterating of his gratious answere; and so the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is herein concluded betwene God, and his people Israel; as we may see more at large by the spetiall favors which God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119621:11"/> sheweth unto Moses which are mentioned in the latter end of the chapter, &amp; so forward.</p>
            <p>Nowe the wordes which I have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly read doe containe in them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation of Moses the man of God, wherein he doth desire of the Lord, (and that earnestlie) that unlesse he would goe with them with his favour and presence, manifested by visible tokens and signes thereof, he would not remove them, from the place where nowe they were, which was in the vallie neare unto Mount Sinai where Moses had receaved the lawe from the mouth of God. <hi>If thy presence goe not with us carry us not up hence.</hi>

            <p>Thy presence] the hebrew word is <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neicha</hi> thy face (coming of <hi>Panah</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to turne or looke to &amp;c.) which is diverslie used in the holie scriptures.

And indeed God is said to be with his people, when he manifesteth his presence by his workes either of mercie towardes them, or judgment against their enemies; and on the other hand, maie be said to be absent from them, when he doth with drawe the former testimonies of his full and free favour for a time; which he doth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119621:12"/> manie times to trie the faith and patience of his people, or to cause them more highlie, and reverently to mynd and esteeme his excellent mercies. Micah. 3: 4. Hos. 5: 6. Soe that here by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God we maie understand, the visible tokens and signes of his presence and favour which in time past they had enioyed, when the Lord marched before them, and brought them out of Egipt, and which nowe by their sinnes they had for a time deprived them selves of. For Moses doth not here onlie praie for the ordinary signes of Gods presence, whereof the world is generally made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in his daylie administrations for the preservation, guidaunce, and governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; but it is Gods spetiall presence; which he in this place beggeth. For though all the world be guided by his providence, &amp; visitation; yet his presence doth not so plainlie appeare anie where, as it doth in governing of his church; as if he should saie, if thou doest not so goe before us, as that we maie as trulie perceive that thou art with us, as if we did behold or see thy verie face perfectlie before us &amp;c. And therefore the force of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119621:13"/> the hebrew word is (as the learned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) not simplie thyface; but in the plurall nomber, thyfaces; as if he should saie, even thou thy selfe with al the tokens and manifestations of thy presence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby our enemies may be destroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and we preserved, and kept in the waie wherein we goe. Which implyeth (as a learned <note n="*" place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Ayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorth.</hi>
               </note> man noteth) Gods care and providence over his people by Christ. Heb. 1: 3. Howe ever it be, Moses sheweth his earnest desire to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God with them, and the great miserie which they should be in without it, in that he chuseth rather to perish in the wildernesse, than to goe further, without the certaine testimonie thereof, which maie be seene in the next verse, where in effect he saith, that the loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour where with God had embraced his people, could not otherwise be knowne unlesse he remained with them.</p>
            <p>But wherefore did Moses thus greatlie desire the favour presence and protection of Almightie God to be with them? Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely to bring them to that good land, the which he had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, a land flowing with-milke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119621:13"/> and honey, which was a type and figure of that heavenly Canaan wherein they should enioy eternall peace and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie whom he had predestinated there unto, as the Israelites did in that land outward rest and peace for a long time: And the people of Israel having by their sins lost the testimonies of Gods presence, and yet commanded of God, to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto that land, he therfore (to the end that they might truly prosper, and goe foorth with safetie and comfort in that which they were to doe) desireth the presence of God.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Doct.

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>So that the point of doctrine arising hence for our Instruction at present is cleare, namely: That in the performaunce of all holy duties, espetially matters that are of weight and great importance, the presence of God to goe with us is aboue all thinges to be desired and earnestly sought for.</p>
            <p>As it stood Moses upon in this case, so it concerneth the Church of Christ in all ages: and therefore we shall find that the people of God in former times when they were well advised, they would at no time take in hand any great matter but they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119621:14"/> did first enquire of the Lord, and seeke his presence; and if they might not have it they chose to let the thing alone. The children of <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20: 12: 26. 27. 28.</note> Israel would not goe to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile against their brethren the children of Benjamine, before they had enquired of the Lord. Ezra the preist and scribe of the lawe of God having received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of silver and gold for the service of the house of the Lord from Artaxerxes the king and his princes, and being to<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezra.</hi> 8: 22. 23: 31. 32.</note> carie it to Jerusalem, he was ashamed to seeke for an armie of souldiers and horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to convey them in safety thither, but proclaymed a fast, and besought the Lords presence, and he delivered them from the handes of their enemyes which laye in waite by the way, and brought them and their treasure in safety to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. Nehemiah also that faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunt of God, hearing of the desolation of<note place="margin">

The like may wee see in Hester<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hest.</hi> 4: 16.</note> the queene being to seeke to the king her

                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 1: 24.</note> the eleven apostles themselves being to chuse one in the place of Judas, although they were largely instructed by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; yet they dare not doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeking the presence and helpe of God, being therein unto us a singular example, that matters of such great weight and importaunce, as is the chusing out of officers for the teaching exhortation and governement of the church of Christ should not lightly or unadvisedly be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, without earnest seeking unto God for his presence, direction and helpe in the same. Yea the presence of God hath bin acknowledged to be of such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie to be sought for, that even wicked and ungodly men have thought it a thing reasonable and expedient, to enquire of the Lord before they tooke in hand great enterprises: as we may see in Ahab who at the perswasion of Jehosaphat enquired<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cron. 18: 4. 5. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> at the word of the Lord, though he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened not unto it. To proceede yet further, verie heathenish and Idolatrous persons, which have not the knowledge of God or his word, have thus much by the instinct of nature, that what soeuer they<note place="margin">

            <p>And there is good reason for it, as<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note> namely, first God himselfe hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it of us, and doth commend it unto us in his word. Nowe what God hath in his word either commanded or commended to be done, that we are bound in duty to performe, and it is sin to neglect or omit the same: but God in his <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Chron. 16: 11.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119621:15"/> therefore we must take heed howe we let slip the doeing of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly where Gods presence is,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reason. Psal.</hi> 16: 11.</note> there is his blessing, favour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there the worke prospereth that is taken in hand, and there is good successe in the doeing of it: for it is in him we<note place="margin">

There is noe sacrifice that is done to him, which he blesseth unlesse his presence be in the doeing of it; there is no duty prospereth unlesse it be taken in hand in his name, and he be present to assist us in the performaunce of it: for he<note place="margin">

               </gap>ooke for no good begining or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous or happie issue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, where Gods presence is there<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note> is God himselfe, and there is his spirit, for the persons of the Trinity are so united in one and the same essence, that they admit no division, or disjunction, but where the one is, there the other worketh: Nowe we knowe that the spirit <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 26.</note> helpeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119621:16"/> our Infirmities, and the wisdome of God is revealed unto us <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nehem. 9: 20. 1 Cor. 2: 10. Eph.</hi> 1: 17.</note> by his spirit, and without the wisdome of God we doe not knowe howe to begin or perfect any good worke, it is the spirit that helpeth <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4: 1.</note> us to trye the Spirits, to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene light and darknesse, betwene good and evill. And if in any action men have need of the helpe and wisdome of Gods spirit, then have we in this which we are goeing about, to discerne of the gifts and graces of God given unto men, and their qualifications for the service of God in his church, to knowe who is fit, and who is not fit, to discerne whome the Lord hath called and whome he hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, where the presence of God<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note> is in the doeing and performing of anie thing▪ there that action being once done and performed, is blessed of God ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Therefore seing this thing which we are about, is a matter which we doe not for a day, or a moneth, or one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer occasion but it is that which (Jam perswaded) all of us desire to have blessed to us alwaies; and that we may not onlie comfortably, and with one heart goe on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119621:16"/> nowe in the performaunce of the action it selfe of choise and ordination of ministers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the church; but that hereafter it may prove to the glorie of God, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and benefit. If this be then our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and earnest intentions, what urgent reason and great occasion have we to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the presence of God.</p>
            <p>But what need is there to insist upon<note place="margin">1 <hi>Vse of reproose.</hi>
               </note> reasons of this doctrine? it is a point which no man will deny, but that it is of absolute necessity: I proceed therefore to applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And first they come here justly to be reproued, that are so carelesse, &amp; negligent many times in the doeing &amp; performaunce of weightie matters, that they rush rudely and unadvisedlie to the doeing of them, without seeking for the presence of God to goe with them; as though the power were in their owne handes to bring to passe whatsoeuer they purpose, and not consider that they are mortall men whose breath is in their nostrils, and that without the Lord no man is able so much as to thinke a good thought, much lesse doe any good deed. Hence it is that men doe so often befoole themselves, and run into confusion, because they neglect
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119621:17"/> the performaunce of this first duty: for God he will be sought unto, or els it is just with him to bring the counsell of men to nought; for unlesse he build the house they<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 127: 1.</note> labour but in vaine that build it &amp;c un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he advise and counsell us in this our undertaking, we maie doe that in hast which we may repent of by leasure. The Lord denounceth a woe by the mouth of the prophet Isaiah against his people (amongst other thinges) for this, saying they walke to goe downe into Egipt (and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 30: 2. 3.</note> have not asked at my mouth) to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en themselves in the strength of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah and to trust in the shadowe of Egipt: therefore shall the strength o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Pharoah be your shame, and the trust in the shadowe of Egipt your confusion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let us hence be exhorted,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Vse. Exhortation.</hi>
               </note> that seing we have nowe a great and weightie busines to take in hand, to wit▪ the chusing out from amongst us some to beare office in the church of Christ, either for governement or administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word and Sacraments, or both, as the Lord shall in mercie afford unto us: oh! let us therefore with unfeigned affections, and earnest desires, humble
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119621:17"/> our selves before God, and earnestly desire his presence to be with us, in the doeing and performing of the same. The Lord<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal. 105: 4. Psal.</hi> 27: 8.</note> calleth upon us in this matter even nowe to seeke his face, if we will have good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successe; and we should be ready, and saie with the psalmist, thy face Lord will we seeke; and not onliewsay it, but also even nowe presently to fall on doeing of it, and that with all our might and never give over till he heare. Certainly he will not stop his eares against us; if we doe but seeke him with fervent faith and due preparation of heart. And therefore that may be an other profittable and seasonable use of this doctrine for us at this time, and it is of<note place="margin">3. <hi>Vse. Examination▪</hi>
               </note> admonition to us, and it may prove whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some advice if we take good heed unto it: to wit; Doe we desire the presence of God to be with us, and his blessing upon us, in the things we take in hand? then let us examine our selves, whither the Lord hath fitted and prepared us (or rather whither we have not made our selves unfit) for such worthie enioyments, as are his ordinaunces, his word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be lively preached, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119621:18"/> among us; and the administration of the affaires of Christs kingdome to be performed in their due manner, that is, by such officers as he hath appointed in his word for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore first examine our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</hi>
               </note> whither wee have the true sence and feeling of our owne nakednesse, want and povertie, howe that we are as sheepe without a sheepheard, and by that meanes in danger of the raving wolfe, and doe therefore in the sence and feeling of this our want and necessitie, desire such to be sent unto us, that we may be defended from the outrage of our adversarie, by their diligent and carefull watching over our soules? doe we see that we are as a body without eies? as a towne without walls? and doe we desire to have these wants supplied that thereby the power of professed adversaries may be kept out, and homebred conspiracies and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries looked into and prevented? doe we feele our selves as a garden without an inclosure, or hedge; and therefore we earnestly desire one, that the wilde boare may be kept out from rooting up the plants which God hat set in his orchard?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119621:18"/> If we have this sence and feeling; then we are in some measure fit for the Lord to bestowe such favours upon us; for he will have us <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5: 6.</note> hungrie, before he feede us, he will have us senceable of our <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Reu.</hi> 3: 17.</note> nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse before he cloth us: for when we feele our owne wants, then doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his blessings and favours the more thankfullie. But on the other hand, if we be so without feeling or sence as that we are indifferent or carelesse herein myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that if we have them it is good, if we have them not we doe not much care our condition is nowe well enough; I saie if this carelesse affection be in us, it makes us altogether unfit for God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Secondly consider, and examine with<note place="margin">2 <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> our selves, what it is that hath made us to be deprived of these favours (thus long) which nowe we desire and hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Is it because the Lord's hand is<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 59: 1. 2.</note> shortened that it cannot save, or his eare heavie that it cannot heare? No doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, for there is with him no chaunging; he remaineth the same for ever, and his yeares doe not faile: but the scripture tels us plaine, yea and our woefull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119621:19"/> doth preach it unto us with open mouth, and if we our selves see it not, our neighbours can tell us, that it is our sinnes that haue separated betwene God and us, and our Iniquities have made him hide his face from us. If ever it were for the sinnes of the Jewes that the citie Jerusalem was <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier. 26: 6. And</hi> 44: 22.</note> made a curse, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination, and hissing to the nations that were round about her; and the house which was built for the service of God was made as Shiloh; and they themselves captivated in a straunge land: then surely it is for our sinnes that the famous church in this city, whereof manie of us have bin members, hath bin thus ruinated and troden under foote, and the members dispersed one from an other, and that not by the handes of an enemy, but (which is lamentable) they have slaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured one an other (God having first bereaved us of those learned and wise watchmen that have by their wisdome, or rather the wisdome of God in them kept us together) in so much that we have bin a wonder and an astonishment to peoples both neare and farre of, both friendes and enemies; our freindes pitying us, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119621:19"/> mourning for us, but not being able by their Counsell to helpe us; and our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rejoyceing and making a mocke at us. Let us then further examine our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and rip up our owne hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; to try and see whither we have trulie repented of those thinges, which have moved the Lord to deprive us of them: for unlesse we have done this, it is but in vaine for us to presume to seeke these ordinaunces of God at his handes, for we shall not have them; but it maie justly be said to us as the Lord saith to the wicked, what hast thou to doe to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 50: 16.</note> my covenant in thy mouth? seing thou hatest instruction &amp;c. So what have we to doe to celebrate Gods ordinances, if wee have not purged our selves of that leven of mallice and roote of bitternesse, for the which the Lord hath deprived us of them, yea and to this day doth keepe them from us; or if we have them bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upod us, it may be to our further and greater judgment, the Lord may deale with us as he did with his people Israel of old, give us a king in his anger and take him away in his wrath, yea, he may<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hosea.</hi> 13: 11.</note>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119621:20"/> give us statutes that are not good, and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20: 25.</note> judgments whereby we should not live. For what the apostle saith of receiving the Lord's supper, that may be applied in a sort to this thing in hand, yea it is in part the same, who soeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 29.</note> unworthily, eateth and drinketh damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himselfe, not discerning the Lord's bodie. Therefore the exhortation which the Apostle giveth in that case may come verie seasonablie unto us at this time; But<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 23.</note> let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup. For repentaunce, and amendement of life, is that salve which cures up these sores, it is a soveraigne medicine to purge away the wrath and displeasure of God from us, it is that which he hath promised to have respect unto, for the Lord is gratious and<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30: 3.</note> mercifull, mightie in pardoning, readie to forgive the sins of his people, he will not turne away his face from us if we returne unto him. Therefore the Lord doth earne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stly exhort his people by his prophets to amend their wayes &amp; their doeings, &amp; to<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 26: 13.</note> obey his voice; &amp; then he will repent him of the evill, that he hath pronounced aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119621:20"/> them, yea there is nothing which God doth more desire, than that a sinner should returne from his wicked wayes and live. And therefore we shall finde that those which have truly feared the Lord have so<note place="margin">Dan. 9: 3. 4. 15: 20. &amp;c. Ezra. 9: 5. 6. &amp;c.</note> humbled themselves, and confessed their sinnes, and the sins of their fathers, and brethren, and have found great mercy at the hands of the Almightie. So that I hope nowe, that there is no man amongst us but will confesse that this point of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our repentaunce is a thing of great importaunce, and that it standeth us in hand to looke to it, least in stead of receaving a blessing we receive a greater judgment than yet we have felt. Nowe I would not be understood as if I meant that anie man can so throughly and so fully repent as we ought; but hath our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce bin serious, and from the heart?<note place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119621:23"/> and needlesse vexations one of an other; abusing of his ordinances upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall matter, which our owne wils and uncharitable dispositions doe beget and ingender: it will be then in vaine for us to boast and say, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple<note place="margin">

To which we shall doe well to take heed, and with good diligence to consider of them: and if we doe (upon this our carefull search and inquiry, together with our earnest prayers to God for the assistance of his good Spirit therein) find any such persons among us, as we can with good assurance esteem worthy to take upon them any of the offices which at the present we are distitute of; we may with good courage and boldnesse goe on to the chusing of them, and certainly the Lord will not faile to be with us; whereas otherwise it were better we should withdraw our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and with patience waite upon the Lord, untill he shalbe pleased to send us such.

            <p>And thus I have don with the first branch or part of this deprecation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; <hi>if thy presence goe not with us:</hi> it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119621:26"/> remaineth that I speake some what briefly of the other member of it; to wit <hi>carry us not hence.</hi> Where it may (for expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations sake) be demaunded, wherefore Moses speaketh thus unto the Lord? To which it may be answered, that surely Moses had great reason to desire rather to abide in the wildernesse, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish there, than to goe forward towards the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> without the presence of God: becaus first, if God should not be the leader and conductor of his people, as in times past be had bin bringing them out of Egipt, they should fall into the enemyes handes, and many dangers over take them▪ their enemies being farre greater and stronger than they. Secondly, the place where now they were was much more free from the enemy, than were the other places and countries through which they must passe in their journie; for here the enemyes came not upon them being as it were in a desolate place where were no inhabitants. Thirdly it were farre more safe for them to stay than to remove farther becaus the nations their enemyes were alwaies much moved against them, when they saw them marching in upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119621:27"/> them; thinking they came to invade thir landes; but so long as they journeyed not, but remained still in their tents, they could not so much suspect it; neither doe we read that at such times they did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily rise up to resist them. Besides in journeying from that place to the land of Canaan, they were to goe through not one only, but the confines of many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and therefore if one did not fight against them, or fighting not prevaile, it might well be expected that an other might, if not an other, yet a third and if not one, yet many joyning their strength and forces together might easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe them, if they had not a suffitient guide and captaine to goe with them, such as were able to deliver them from them all, which was only God.</p>
            <p>So that (these thinges thus considered) it may appeare that the children of Israel had bin in poore case, if they had not with them the presence of God; and Moses therfore had suffitient ground to pray thus as the text declareth and thence<note place="margin">2. <hi>Doctrine Misery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth those that are vvithout God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
               </note> may arise this second point or observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, That it is a miserable and unhappie thing to be without, or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119621:27"/> deprived of the presence, and favour of the Lord, in any estate whatsoeuer. This we may see here in Moses, who desired rather to stay in a solitary place, than to goe into that good land of Canaan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's presence. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
               </label> where Gods presence is lacking, there is nothing but confusion and distraction: as we may see in that example of the children of Israel, who presumed, and would goe up unto the land which the Lord had promised, not with standing<note place="margin">Numb. 14: 42. 43. &amp;c.</note> that Moses had (from the mouth of the Lord) charged them not to goe up, becaus the Lord was not with them; yet they presuming contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given unto them, how were they discomfitted and smitten? It is an example worthy of our espetiall notice, and may serve for a good caution to all to take heed how they attempt the doing of matters upon their owne wils and powers, without the will and power of God. The Lord also (by the mouth<note place="margin">Isa. 30: 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.</note> of his prophet Isaiah) complaineth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the rebellion of Israel, becaus they tooke counsell but not of him, they walked to goe downe into Egipt (and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119621:28"/> asked not at his mouth) and strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egipt; wherefore he threatened, that the strength of Pharaoh should he their shame, &amp; the trust in the shadow of Egipt, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. The which may yet further<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron. 18: 18. 19. 25. 33. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> be manifested in the example of Ahab king of Israell who (notwithstanding Micajah the prophet of the Lord had warned him of the danger of goeing up to Ramath Gilead, and that if he went he should fall there) would presume to goe up, trusting to his false and lying prophets, and not regarding the word of the Lord: but what successe he had in his bold enterprise the historie doth at large declare. So that we may behold the truth of that which Solomon saith in his proverbes, there is no wisdome, nor understanding, nor counsell against the Lord. For as in the presence and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 30.</note> favour of God there is life▪, comfort and good successe; so in the lack of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence there is no thing but woe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
            <p>Seing then it is so that the enioying <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Vse. </seg>
               </label> of Gods presence is so happy, and such
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119621:28"/> prosperity and good successe cometh by the having and enioying of it, and the not having of it bringeth all miserie; let us be exhorted to take heed and beware of that which is the cause wherefore we ate deprived of his presence, and wherefore the Lord doth not goe forth with our armies as in times past; which is Sin: and let us flye from it, as from deadly poyson, which though it be sweete and dilitious in the taste, yet is deadly in the operation; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To conclude, wee see here that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses doth rather chuse to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with a meane and lowe estate, a solitary and desolate life in a land which was barren, and fruitlesse, where they had no thing but Mannah to feed on, than to goe into that great and good land whereof the Lord had spoken unto them, which flowed with milke and honie, with, out the visible tokens and signes of God's presence. Whence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119621:29"/> we may also note, That a meane and<note place="margin">3 <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

And in such resolutions we need not to feare, wee have the word of God, his law for our warrant and he will bear us out in it. As lawyers will say to their Clyents; I understand the matter well, you have the law on your side, goe foorth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119621:45"/> in your suite; I'le warrrant you the case: So may we say one to an other in godly resolutions; yea this the word of God doth in effect tell us.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119621:51"/> Judgement corrupted; to receave a gift to pervert or wrest a matter in the judgment of it; that is, for the gift or reward to doe contrary to law &amp; equity; which the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cited doe plainly shew. But it doth no waie condemne gifts &amp; presents which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours give to their superiours, or supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours to their inferiours, or one friend to an other, in token of homage, honour, or friendship: for this is a part of that love &amp; mutuall friendship which we are to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve either to other, for the upholding of mutuall affection &amp; society among us; &amp; very usefull &amp; profitable it is, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose among men. So <hi>Jacob</hi> doth here send a present to <hi>Joseph,</hi> not to have him wrest judgment or pervert justice for his sake; but to testifie his observance and respect towards him, &amp; also his thankfulnesse for his former good will &amp; favour towards his sons. Besides <hi>Iacob</hi> doth this not without the singuler motion of God's spirit, &amp; his providence (as was noted before in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the generall scope of the chapter) for so he unwittingly fulfilleth the dreame of <hi>Ioseph</hi> in bowing downe to him in this his present, wherein he acknowledgeth reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour to him, as well as if he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119621:51"/> had in person done obeysance. These considerations therfore being had of this matter, it will appeare hence plainly to be lawfull for men to send presents either to other in this sort as <hi>Jacob</hi> doth; so as it be done, not out of a false, or faigned, but true and sincere respect and affection.</p>

The wordes themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, <hi>If I am bereaved, I am bereaved,</hi> thus vehementlie spoken, doe shew the great griefe and sorrow that <hi>Iacob</hi> was in to part with his sons, and the earnest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wherewith he prayeth for their restoration; together also with his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like resolution to rest in God's pleasure. Whence on the one hand may be noted what naturall affection there should be between parents and children: that the child should be deare to the parents, no thing more deare in this life than it, for it is (as it were) a branch of them the tree; it is part of them; flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone. There is such a neare relation that God doth in scripture make use of it to represent and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay before us the love which he beareth towards his elect. Therefore when we see at any time parents carelesse and negligent of their children, we may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that they are unnaturall, and degenerate from this naturall affection which was in <hi>Iacob.</hi> Ad on the other hand, how greatly it standeth children in hand, to honour and reverence such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as doe so dearly affect them. Againe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119621:58"/> parents are by this example of <hi>Iacob</hi> taught that in all things which happen to their children (whē they have done their best, &amp; praied to God for his blessing) they must rest in the disposing hand of God. Though the Lord be pleased to bereave them of a<note place="margin">

            <p>Before he cometh to speake of the<note place="margin">Contens of the chapter.</note> birth of Christ, he doth particulerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late some spetiall thinges of note and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which were as occurences or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to the same, and administred (by the determinate counsell and fore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of God, and according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which he had before declared by his servants the prophets) in, upon, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the instruments of Christ's nativity, and manifestation unto the world: which is the somme and substance of this chapter now read. Wherein we may observe these generall parts. First, the preface <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> unto the whole historie in the foure first verses. Secondly, the message sent from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God by the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> unto <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> the priest, as he was executing his charge; foretelling the birth of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, who should be the fore runner of our Saviour Christ, and prepare the way before him: togither with the signe that was given to <hi>Zacharias</hi> of the truth of it; and his wives conceaving according to the word of the Lord, from vers 4. to the 26<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. Thirdly, the message sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from God unto the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the ministerie of the same Angell; wherein he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119621:62"/> doth (first) salute her with assurance of great favour in the sight of God, and (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly) foretelleth unto her the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and birth of our saviour in and of her wombe, being a virgin; by the working of the holy ghost. And also (thirdly) confirmeth the same to her by the tydings of her cousin Elizabeth's conceaving, who was called barren. Whereunto is added Mary's faith, and submission to the will of God. From thence to vers 39. Fourthly, we have Maryes visitation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> salutation of Elizabeth: and againe Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths salutation and blessing of Mary, and manifestation of that which should come to passe. to vers 46. Fiftly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> magnificat or song of praise, which she (by the motion of the spirit) uttered presently upon the hearing of Elizabeth's wordes. From thence to vers 57. Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and lastly, we have declared to us the birth of John the Baptist, his circumcision, and denomination, both by his father and mother (agreing in one) contrary to the mindes of their kinred and friendes: yet according to the direction of the Angell before he was conceaved, to the great astonishment of them which dwelled
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119621:63"/> there about. Whereunto is added the opening of Zacharias his mouth (who had bin dombe from the time that the Angell first spake unto him of these things) and his prophesying not only of his owne son who was to be the fore runner, but also of the Messias himself. Thence to the end of this chapter.</p>
            <p>This scripture is very large, &amp; plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of heavenly doctrines, &amp; the time but short werein we are to treat upon the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: I shall therfore passe by all that might be spoken both from the generall scope, and many particuler arguments in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and addresse my selfe only to the 33<seg rend="sup">th</seg> verse, whence I shall desire to speake a fewe wordes to edification exhortation &amp; comfort; as God shall make me able, and so give place.</p>
            <p>The wordes are thus. <hi>And he shall</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vers</hi> 33.</note>
               <hi>raigne over the house of Iacob for ever: and of his kingdome there shalbe none end.</hi> The which wordes are a part of the second par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler or branch of the third generall part of this chapter according to the former division, to wit, the testimony which the Angell giveth unto Mary, the virgin of our Saviour Christ, who was to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119621:63"/> in, &amp; borne of her body. And they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve dependance upon the foregoeing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des being connexed or coupled thereunto by the conjunction <hi>And.</hi> The Angell (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said unto her that she should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave and bring forth a sonne, and should call his name Jesus) goeth on to declare his power and majesty, saying, he shalbe great and shalbe called the son of the highest, and the Lord shall give unto him the throne of his father David: whereunto he addeth (for the further setting forth of this his regall power) these wordes which I have taken in hand to speake from, saying, <hi>And he shall raigne over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdome there shalbe none end.</hi> So that the wordes are a part of the declaration which the Angell maketh of the kingly office of Christ, whom we are to understand by the word, <hi>He,</hi> that is the child Jesus before spoken of. The wordes, (though they need no division at all into parts, becaus they are one entire sentence, and spoken of one person without difference of time or place, &amp;c. yet they) afford unto us<note place="margin">Conclusions▪</note> these three things as three seuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions in them layd downe, and by us
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119621:64"/> to be considered, as namely, First, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ who was borne of this virgin Mary is a king. Secondly, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is the house of Jacob. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that his kingdome hath or shall have no end, but is everlasting.</p>
            <p>In the handling of which propositions divers considerations might be had worthy our labour and attendance, if the occasion would give leave, but what can an houres time afford us in the handling of that subject which requireth our whole lives meditation, and contemplation? Therfore I shalbe very briefe herein.<note place="margin">Christ is a King.</note> And first, that he is a king none that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him will deny, yet (that our faith may not be mere Imagination, or our knowledge nothing but fancie) we may see the old and new testament full of proofes.

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 4. 5.</note>
               <hi>the adoption, and glory, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and the giving of the lawe; &amp; the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom (as concerning the flesh) Christ came;</hi> who are nowe (for their sins) dispersed, and scattered farre and nigh throughout the world, are cast out of the vineyard of God for their ill husbandrie. And if it should be over this only that Christ should raigne, then his kingdome would not be so great as becometh such a great and potent king to have. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words may not thus be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. Besides we shall find in scripture divers other speeches of Christ in the like kinde, that should they be understood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally could not but be absurd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, as namely, (among many) that of the prophet Jeremy who saith <hi>And they</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 30: 9.</note>
               <hi>shall serve the Lord their God and David their king whom I will raise up unto them.</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:119621:70"/> Which if it should be understood literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were absurd; but being understood of Christ (of whom David was a type, and of his house and lineage Christ should arise, and so be David his son according to the flesh) then the speech is proper, and the prophesie verified as we assuredly know and beleeve. So when as God saith of Solomon <note n="p" place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17: 12. 14.</note>
               <hi>I will establish his throne for ever, and I will settle him in myne house, and in my kingdome for ever, and his throne shalbe established for evermore;</hi> if it be understood only of Solomon the son of David who imediatly succeeded him in the kingdome, and built the Lord an house, wee see it is otherwise come to passe, yea and it came so to passe (not long after his death) that the kingdome was divided, and his throne was not esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in that state and dignity as then Davids was, but ten tribes thereof rent from him; and now we see on earth no footsteps of his earthly dominion. But if it be understood of Christ the true So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon (of whom the other was a figure) who is also the true and naturall seed of David, that promise of God holdeth firme unto eternity. And this may be plainly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119621:71"/> understood by a speech of David himselfe in his life time spoken by the spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, saying, <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 16: 10.</note>
               <hi>thou wilt not leave my soule in hell: neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.</hi> The which speech the Apostle <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act</hi> 2: 29. 30. 31.</note> Peter doth largely shew not to be spoken by the prophet of himselfe, though he speaketh in his owne person for he hath seen corruption, being dead and buryed and rotten in grave many hundred yeares since: but that he spake it concerning Christ whom God raised up, and he sawe no corruption.</p>
            <p>It being thus then, it followeth that we enquire and labour to understand whom it is that the holy ghost intendeth here by the house of Jacob. Wee must know ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all the faithfull people of God, such as have bin, are or shalbe truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the faith of the gospell, which was preached unto <note n="s" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3: 15.</note>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> shadowed out by divers ceremonies of the lawe, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied of by the prophets, &amp; in the fulnes of time manifestly accomplished by Christ himselfe the mediator of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and which wee (through the mercy of God) have receaved, those are the true house of Jacob, of what countrie, nation,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119621:71"/> people, or language soeuer they be. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many proofes might be brought to manage this interpretation, yet bearing in mynd what formerly hath bin spoken it will not be so absolutly necessary to spend time therein. Notwithstanding that the thing may shine the more clearly to our sence it shalbe suffitient evidence, if we doe read with understanding the nineth chapter of the epistle to the Romanes throughout at our leasure, there we shall see this very point plainly demonstrated, and manie scriptures therein opened, which doe further declare the same where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Apostle doth plainly prove that all are not Israel that are of Israel, and so consequently they are not only the house of Jacob who are so according to the flesh. Neither are they only the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God that are the naturall seed of Abraham, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed, that is, they that are of the faith of Abraham they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true seed of Abraham, they are the true house of Jacob, whither they be Jewes or Gentiles, circumcised or uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, male or female bond or free. These priviledges or conditions doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119621:72"/> further nor hinder; God is no respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of persons, all are one in Christ Jesus. For it is by the bloud of Jesus Christ (the vertue whereof we apply unto our selves by faith) that we (who some times<note place="margin">Eph. 2: 11. 12. 13. &amp;c.</note> were farre off (being gentiles and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in the flesh) yea which were without Christ being aliens from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Israel, strangers from the covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in this present world) are now made nigh; for he is our peace who hath made both one, and hath broken downe the middle wall of partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, &amp;c. So that we are now no more strangers and forreyners, but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens with the saints, and of the household of God. For as by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision (after they had embraced the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to Abraham and law of Moses) those that were strangers, and not of the seed of Jacob, made themselves Israelites in a kinde, and pertakers of the same cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and promises, and submitted them selves unto, and were made partakers of the lawes and ordinances with them, which none that was a stranger indeed might partake of: So by faith (which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119621:72"/> worketh by love) we are made actually the true seed of Abraham, to whom God hath respect principally in all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>For he is not a</hi>

There where it flourisheth most, it is but the least nomber; the glory of the world doth farre overtop the outward beauty and glory of the kingdome of Christ. Let us not marvaile at this brethren, the reason of all this is plaine; becaus Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world, not from hence, he is not an earthly prince, a worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate a temporall governour: but he is an heavenly Monarch, a spirituall king, an <note n="p" place="margin">

Yea the scripture telleth us plainly in divers <note n="t" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim. 4: 18. Heb. 11: 16. And 12: 22. Mat. 16: 19.

            <p>So then it followeth, seing it is not an Earthly, but an heavenly kingdome, how Christ doth execute &amp; administer this his office in and over the subjects of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? The subjects of Christ his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">

In and over whom Christ doth administer his kingly office; first by giving and publishing his holy word unto men, and bestowing gifts upon men, and inabling them to declare and preach his gospell, and manifest and reveale the secret mysteries of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly doctrine to them. This is like unto the decrees statutes and proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which earthly kinges put forth for the calling of their subjects to obedience, and shewing to them what they ought to doe, and what they ought to shun, that they may not be brought under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of transgression; And this is that whereby earthly princes make their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects inexcusable if they doe not obey. And hereby our King Christ leaveth all the world, and sons of Adam without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, in that he hath spread abroad his <note n="v" place="margin">

In which example of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119621:87"/> Jacob we may see a fulfilling of that common proverb, Parting is a pain, but meeting is a joy againe.</p>
            <p>In the first of these generall parts, we<note place="margin">The first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</note> may observe, first the manner how Ioseph made himself knowen unto his bretheren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vers 1. 2. 3. 4.

For first he doth not adde affliction to the afflicted but seing them in great feare and astonishment (partly becaus they saw now (contrary to<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vers</hi> 5. 6. 7. 8.</note> their expectation) Ioseph to be a prince, whom of late they thought either to be deceased and perished from off the earth, or to be a poore and meane bondslave or servant; and partly becaus of the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their consciences for the sin which they had committed, being also ashamed▪ to looke upon their brother, whome they

Secondly, he doth not insult over them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (they being guilty and he innocent) with threatenings of revenge, as is the custome and practise of wicked and ungodly men, or with taunts and checks of rebuke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus of the greatnesse of his suffering at their hands, as the manner of some is that would seeme righteous, when their brother hath sinned to lay strong and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy loades and aggravations of sin upon him: but useth arguments to them to take away their feare, and freely manifesteth his pardoning of the injurie done unto him, in effect, though not so largely as afterwards he doth, Cap. 50: 19. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> neither doth he rejector despise them (being poore and in distresse, and he a

            <p>This serveth therfore to reprove first,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Vse. Of reproofe.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:119621:90"/> the great neglect which is even among God's people themselves of this brotherly fellowship, in comforting one another in time of distresse. Wee maie many times heare of the sicknesse, poverty, griefe and affliction of our poore bretheren, or sisters; but there is little paines taken in visiting, them. If they be rich or such as we espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially respect, then runne and ride, goe and come, early and late, for and unto them; but the poore in their adversity are too too much neglected. Wee visit them when we have leasure, or little else to doe. I am sure, if my finger doe ake or grieve me, or my toe be sore, I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently taking care to apply some help or comfort to it; and I thinke it is so with others: oh! that the like care could be shewed to the poore members of Christ, as is to the members of our naturall bodie.

            <p>Secondly, they come here also justly to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be reproved that in stead of comfort in adversity, doe administer discomfort and cause of heavines unto the poore afflicted. If they heare of a brother or sister to have any thing befallen them, they bethinke presently of some wrong and evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the cause of their suffering; &amp; if they come to visite them, either through ignorance they are unable to speake comfortablie to them, or els by reason of a prejudicate opinion wherewith they are carryed away (like Job's three freinds) they increase the sorrow of the afflicted by their tantings and unjust or sensorious reproofes.</p>

And having thus considered, pitie him, lovingly admonish him, praie for him, and in praying for him remember thy selfe also, that thou majest be kept from the like evill. Consider what the scripture saith, <note n="g" place="margin">

               <hi>it is a more blessed thing to give than to receave:</hi> So it is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119621:95"/> to suffer wrong, than to doe any, or to seeke vengeance. What greater wrong could be offered to a person, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire against his life, and to make him awaie, as the sons of Jacob did to Joseph? yet behold Joseph's compassion is such towards them, that he doth not seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but rather administreth comfort to them.

For we see by common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that anger conceaved or boiling against a mans selfe is commonly more depressed, than to shew it selfe so openly, becaus men have by nature a greater love to themselves: but when a man is sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainlie moved by an other, his blood will rise against him. To which purpose (me thinkes) tendeth that exhortation of Joseph to his brethren, saying <hi>See that ye fall not out by the way.</hi> Yet I find <hi>Charah</hi>

By this faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it might come to passe (as it doth to us at this day in the like case) that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph knew that he was sent of God into Egypt, that his brethren and the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites were the instruments of God in this worke; but the evill which his bretheren both thought and intended, yea and did (as much as in them was) commit, that God by his divine wisdome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse turned both to his and their good. This faith and knowledge is the first rise or step of godlinesse and comfort, but the ignorance of this doctrine is the high way to error prophanenesse and desparation.

But it may be more apparantly and probably alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for answere, that he perceaved and knew it by the event and issue of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe, which did plainly declare thus much. For he knew well enough that the intent of his brethren was nought els but mischeife and evill to him, and not the least desire of preferment, but rather subjection and enslaving of Ioseph: and now he saw that it was other wise come to passe, his dreames were in part fulfilled, it was better befallen him than they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he had already given them come for their supply, and now was able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine his bretheren like a prince; to whom should he then ascribe this but to the Lord?

               <hi>faith is the evidence of things not seene.</hi> but when we have that which with confidence we hoped for, then we believe that particuler to come no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for we have it in performance; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we conclude that it is so and so come to passe by the providence of God. Thus Ioseph here concludeth by the event of this plot against him, that God had sent him into Egypt. And thus we may safely and without danger conclude upon the like perillous cases, when we see that they turne to our good, that it is the Lord that hath sent this or that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes unto us whereby we attaine therunto through God's over ruling of it. And thus much in effectour Saviour teacheth Joh. 16: 4. and 13: 7. An other objection <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> ariseth hence, to wit, whither Ioseph (saying that God sent him hither, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vers 8. not you but God &amp;c.) doth nor seeme to make God the author of the sin committed by his brethren? To <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ansvv. </seg>
               </label> which I answere, No, in no wise; for his brethren intended no thing lesse than the sending of him into Egypt to preserve
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119621:102"/> their lives: and therfore when they sold him they did not say, come let us send him into Egypt by the Midianitish merchants, that he may there provide for us in time of dearth; <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 37: 27</note>
               <hi>but comelet us sell him to the Ismae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> not caring what they did with him whither carry him into Egypt &amp; sell him there, or keepe him to thē selves as a bond slave and servant; all was one to them so they were freed of him, and might heare no more of his dreames, nor have him any longer eye sore to them. This was the wicked worke of his brethren, but the bringing of him into Egypt &amp; there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him to this great dignitie, that was the worke of God himselfe, as Ioseph here truly confesseth. To the bringing to passe wherof God doth no lesse justly and holylie make use of the wickednesse of Ioseph's brethren, and the Midianites, than he did the wickednesse of the thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and Satan in trying Iob, and of Iudas and the people to redeeme mankind by the death of his sonne. In this Ioseph teacheth us how in the like events we should judge and discerne betweene the worke of God and the sin of men. The bretheren sin; 1: becaus they doe a thing
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119621:102"/> absolutlie unlawfull. 2. they did it with wicked affections, and to an evill end; to wit, in hatred to, and for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting away of their brother. But God doth that which is most holy; first by a secret motion he moveth the Midianites to bring him into Egypt, &amp; not els where. 2. he did it for a good end, namely to preserve life. But God neither intended, nor approved the sin in their action; but suffered it to goe along with his must just and gratious worke, that of his admirable wisdome and goodnesse he might (as it were) bring light out of darknesse.</p>
            <p>Further it may be objected, whither this <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> speech of Ioseph doth not seeme to absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve his bretheren of sin, and make them guiltlesse, seing it was the will and worke of God to bring Ioseph into Egypt? I <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ansvv. </seg>
               </label> answere, No: for there are two thinges necessarily required of those that doe that which God willeth, &amp; to make thēselves free of condemnation of guiltinesse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they can no wise be excused before God or men. First that the action be commanded of God, and doe agree with his revealed will, which is the only rule of righteousnesse for us, whereby we
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119621:103"/> are to knowe what to doe, and what to leave undone. Secondly, that it be done in faith, and with a desire of obedience to God's will certainly made knowen to us. But neither of these can be said to be here in this act: for the lawe of God is so farre from commanding the selling of a brother for a bond servant, that it wholly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det it, and that not only in one but seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commandements. Neither did they doe it with desire to please God, but to fulfill their malice hatred and evill wills against their harmlesse and innocent bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore in either respects they grievously sinned.</p>
            <p>In that Joseph here (having bin by the malice of his brethrē sold to the Midiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and by them brought into Egypt, and there through the malice and evill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his mistresse imprisoned and kept in great bondage and affliction: and being now at length raised to dignity there) acknowledgeth it to be the worke<note place="margin">4 <hi>Doctrine.

               </note> of God that brought him thither; we may gather hence to our selves this lesson. That in every estate and condition which doth befall us in this life, whither prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or adversitie, we must not principally
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119621:103"/> respect the instruments by which the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is wrought or brought to passe: but looke upon the providence of God who disposeth all thinges according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and will. Thus doth David behave himselfe in the case of Shimei, when he cursed him; he looked not so much upon the sin of Shimei, as upon the Lord without whose providence and permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he could not have done it. <note n="e" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16: 10.</note>
               <hi>Becaus</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Lord hath said unto him, curse David; who shall then saie wherfore hast thou done it?</hi> Thus the Lord himself testifieth concerning the affliction of his people by the Assyrians, that it was not they principally, but the Lord (by them) that afflicted Israel. <note n="f" place="margin">

               <hi>O Assyrian, the rod of myne anger and the staffe in their hand is myne indignation.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119621:108"/> the messenger of death (sicknesse) sent unto him to prepare and bring him thereunto; he doth before his departure (by the instruction of the Spirit of God) set his house in order; and that not only in respect of temporall, but also of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thinges. For in this chapter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the last speech of this holie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch to his sons not long before his death. And it consisteth of two partes. First, prophesie. Secondly, precept. In his propheticall speech or oration he doth declare unto them, <hi>that which should befall them in the last dayes.</hi> In the precept he giveth them command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his buryall.</p>
            <p>Manie thinges he doth by the Spirit of prophesie foretell unto them, which have bin performed in the ages following, and long after his departure, and they are both good and evill; but espetially of the future division of the land of Canaan amongst their families; and of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the tribe of Judah, and of the Messiah which was to come of the same stocke. The which prophesie he shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up with a generall blessing. So that it may be called the blessing of Jacob,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119621:109"/> pronounced to his sons (though it be not without some curses unto some of them) becaus of what Moses saith of it Vers 28. Or it may be called the last will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of Jacob, becaus he doth herein (as the servant and minister of God) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute, or pronounce unto his sons, their severall partes and portions in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes of God, both Spirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: even as a naturall father doth his goods unto his children; for that is no more in the power of naturall parents, than was this which Jacob did, in his; for they are but stewardes of God, and his ministers in the distributing of the one and the other. For it is God that is the prime and effitient giver of them, and without him no blessing temporall or Spirituall can be conferred upon anie.</p>
            <p>In the chapter we have these generall partes. 1. The blessing or Testament of Jacob to his sons to Vers 29. 2. His command concerning his buriall, to Vers 33. 3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg> his death. vers last.</p>
            <p>In the first of which generall parts, we maie observe many particulers, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely. 1. The preparation which Jacob maketh to pronounce this prophesie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119621:109"/> Vers 1. 2. which hath respect to all his sons in generall. 1. He calleth them unto him, saying, <hi>gather your selfes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, &amp;c.</hi> Vers 1. 2. being come he exhorteth them (1) again to a joynt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling and gathering togither about him, that so they might all be the better partakers of what he should speak, being now a sick man lying in his bed Vers 2. Then (2) to audience and attention with diligence, they being his last wordes that he had to speak unto them; that so they might not be frustrate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or instruction, which they should receave thereby: adding thereunto a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to move them to attention, taken partly from themselves, they were his sons, thereby bound to obey him in this; and partly from himself, in respect of his name, he was Jacob the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, to whom the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were made, and also Israell, a name given him of God, becaus <hi>he had wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God and prevailed,</hi> and was the prophet of the Lord, to whom the Lord by his Spirit revealed thinges to come; &amp; partly in respect of his place, he was their father, and therfore with reverence
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119621:110"/> and due attention to be hearkened unto by them his sons, espetially now in his last wordes. Secondly, his prophesie of his twelve sons in particuler; as namely (1) Reuben Vers 3. 4. (2) Simeon and Levi Vers 5. 6. 7. (3) Judah. to vers 13. and so foorth of the rest. Nowe becaus it is my purpose (by God's grace) to speak somewhat in particuler of Judah's prediction, I shall therfore forbeare to speake further of the generall, but make a staie here on this particuler.</p>
            <p>Wherein we may note. 1. The person whom this prophesie concerneth; namely <hi>Iudah,</hi> to whom Jacob doth seem to ascribe (as it were with a cheerful Spirit) more honour and dignitie, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119621:111"/> that he meritted no such praise at the handes of God, or men, but rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: yet we see how the Lord after his repentance doth cover his sin, and accept him into such great favour, that he maketh him the cheife ruler, and of him came the Kinges of Iudah, yea and Christ himselfe according to the flesh, who is the King, preist, and prophet of his Church.

For the Kingly Majestie and supream power is given more clearly to Iudah than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he saith, that <hi>the scepter shall not depart &amp;c. untill. &amp;c.

               <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his ecclesiasticall history Lib. 1. Cap. 7. saith when Herod the first of them which unto Israell are counted strangers receaved rule over the Iewish nation; the prophesie written by Moses in that behalf was fulfilled, which said, there shall not want a prince in Iudah, neither a leader faile of his loynes, untill he come for whom it was kept and reserved, whom he pronounced to be the expectation of the gentiles.

            <p>
               <hi>The Scepter,</hi> in Hebrew <hi>Shebet.</hi> This word I find by our translators to have a threefold signification or use: 1: a rod or scepter: 2: a tribe or generation des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending of a patriarch. 3. Chastening or correction, by a metaphor, Job. 21: 9. And by reason of the various rendering of the word divers opinions are taught from this text. The word properly doth signifie a rod or staffe, and is by Moses applyed to the tribes of Israell in the mentioning of them. And the cause of his naming a tribe <hi>Shebet,</hi> doth seem to be either from that the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the children of Israell to take twelve rods, one of every prince according to the house of their fathers, and to write every mans name upon his rod &amp;c. Nom. 17: 2. Or els, becaus the twelve tribes grew out of the stock of Israell as branches, rods, or staffes out of a tree. So the greeke translators doe interpret it often. 1 Sam. 10: 19. 20. 21. 1 King. 11: 32. 35. 36. Wherfore mr. Aynsw. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth the prophesie to be that Judahs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119621:117"/> tribe should continue distinct untill Christ's coming, wheras the other ten tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes were scattered and confused by their captivity, 2 Kings. 17: 18. out of which they returned not, as the tribe of Judah with Benjamine did from Babilon Ezra. 1: 5. and <seg rend="sup">mr</seg>
               <hi>Broughton</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth it (as before) of the tribe of Benjamine which was a <hi>Shebet,</hi> that it should not depart from the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah. It signifieth or implyeth also the power of goverment which should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this tribe; for <hi>Shebet</hi> (as <seg rend="sup">mr</seg> Aynsw. saith) signifieth also a scepter (which is a rod or staffe of power given to princes in token of authority) and so the word is rendered, Psal. 45: 6. The greeke translate it here a prince; and that seemeth to be becaus of Psal. 110: 2. where it may be so well understood, but by a figure, viz <hi>the rod of thy strength,</hi> for him that shall have the scepter of thy strength.
